  "content": "Based on the findings you've provided, here are specific remediations for each of the identified OWASP vulnerabilities:\n\n### 1. **Input Validation and Sanitization (A1: Injection)**\n- **Use a Validation Library**: Implement a library like `express-validator` to handle input validation more comprehensively. This will allow you to define validation rules and sanitization methods for the `type` parameter.\n  \n  ```javascript\n  const { query, validationResult } = require('express-validator');\n\n  methods.summary = [\n    query('type').optional().isIn(['week', 'month', 'year']).withMessage('Invalid type'),\n    async (req, res) => {\n      const errors = validationResult(req);\n      if (!errors.isEmpty()) {\n        return res.status(400).json({ success: false, errors: errors.array() });\n      }\n      // Proceed with the rest of the logic\n    }\n  ];\n  ```\n\n### 2. **Aggregation Pipeline Security (A1: Injection)**\n- **Sanitize User Input**: Ensure that the `type` parameter is not only validated but also sanitized before being used in the aggregation pipeline. While Mongoose does provide some protection, it's best to avoid any direct usage of user input in queries.\n  \n  ```javascript\n  const sanitizedType = ['week', 'month', 'year'].includes(type) ? type : defaultType;\n  ```\n\n### 3. **Data Exposure (A3: Sensitive Data Exposure)**\n- **Limit Fields Returned**: Use Mongoose projections to limit the fields returned in the aggregation result. This will help ensure that sensitive information is not exposed in the API response.\n  \n  ```javascript\n  const pipeline = [\n    {\n      $facet: {\n        totalClients: [\n          {\n            $match: { removed: false, enabled: true },\n          },\n          {\n            $count: 'count',\n          },\n        ],\n        newClients: [\n          {\n            $match: { removed: false, created: { $gte: startDate.toDate(), $lte: endDate.toDate() }, enabled: true },\n          },\n          {\n            $count: 'count',\n          },\n        ],\n        activeClients: [\n          {\n            $lookup: {\n              from: InvoiceModel.collection.name,\n              localField: '_id',\n              foreignField: 'client',\n              as: 'invoice',\n            },\n          },\n          {\n            $match: { 'invoice.removed': false },\n          },\n          {"
