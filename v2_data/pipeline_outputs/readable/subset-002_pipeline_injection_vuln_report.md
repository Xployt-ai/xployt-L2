The provided code contains a function that generates a summary of clients based on certain criteria using MongoDB aggregation with Mongoose. While the code appears to be functional, there are several potential security vulnerabilities and best practices that should be considered:

### 1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - The `type` parameter from `req.query` is validated against a hardcoded list of acceptable values (`['week', 'month', 'year']`). While this is a good practice, it is important to ensure that all user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks. Although the current implementation checks for valid types, consider using a library like `express-validator` for more comprehensive validation.

### 2. **Error Handling**
   - The error handling in the case of an invalid `type` is minimal. While it returns a 400 status code, it could be improved by logging the error for debugging purposes. Additionally, consider handling unexpected errors (e.g., database errors) gracefully to avoid exposing sensitive information.

### 3. **Aggregation Pipeline Security**
   - The aggregation pipeline is constructed using user input (specifically the `type` parameter). While the input is validated, ensure that the aggregation itself does not allow for any injection or manipulation of the database queries. Although Mongoose handles this well, always be cautious about how user input is used in queries.

### 4. **Potential Denial of Service (DoS)**
   - The aggregation pipeline could potentially be resource-intensive, especially if the dataset is large. If an attacker sends a large number of requests in a short period, it could lead to performance degradation. Implement rate limiting on the endpoint to mitigate this risk.

### 5. **Data Exposure**
   - The aggregation results are returned directly in the response. Ensure that no sensitive information is included in the response, especially if the `Client` model contains sensitive data. Consider using a projection to limit the fields returned in the aggregation.

### 6. **MongoDB Security Best Practices**
   - Ensure that the MongoDB instance is secured and not exposed to the public internet. Use authentication and authorization to restrict access to the database.
   - Make sure that the `removed` and `enabled` fields are properly indexed if they are frequently queried to improve performance.

### 7. **Moment.js Usage**
   - The code uses `moment.js`, which is a well-known library for date manipulation. However, it is worth noting that `moment.js` is now considered a legacy project. Consider using alternatives like `date-f
