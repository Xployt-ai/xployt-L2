"Based on the provided findings, here are the issues related to the OWASP Top 10:\n\n### 1. **Sensitive Data Exposure (A3:2021)**\n- **Hardcoded Secrets**: The `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and other sensitive information are hardcoded in the code. This can lead to exposure if the code is shared or stored in a public repository.\n  - **Recommendation**: Ensure that sensitive information is stored securely in environment variables and not hardcoded. Use a secrets management tool if necessary.\n\n- **Environment Variable Management**: The code loads environment variables from `.env` and `.env.local` files. If these files are not properly secured or are included in version control, sensitive information can be leaked.\n  - **Recommendation**: Ensure that `.env` files are included in `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed to version control. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for managing environment variables in production.\n\n### 2. **Security Misconfiguration (A5:2021)**\n- **Error Handling**: The error handling for the MongoDB connection logs the error message directly to the console. This could expose sensitive information about the database or application structure.\n  - **Recommendation**: Avoid logging sensitive error messages. Instead, log a generic error message and consider using a logging library that can handle different log levels and outputs.\n\n### 3. **Injection (A1:2021)**\n- **MongoDB Connection String**: The MongoDB connection string is taken from the environment variable `DATABASE`, but there is no validation or sanitization of this input. If an attacker can manipulate this variable, they could potentially connect to a malicious database.\n  - **Recommendation**: Validate the format of the MongoDB connection string before using it. Consider using a library that can help with this.\n\n### 4. **Insecure Deserialization (A8:2021)**\n- **Glob Pattern Usage**: The use of `globSync` to load model files can potentially lead to loading unintended files if the glob pattern is not specific enough.\n  - **Recommendation**: Ensure that the glob pattern is specific to the intended files and does not allow for arbitrary file loading.\n\nThese findings highlight critical areas that need to be addressed to mitigate risks associated with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities."
