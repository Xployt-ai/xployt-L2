"The provided code snippet contains several potential security vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Below is an analysis of the code with a focus on security concerns:\n\n### 1. **Hardcoded Secrets**\n- **Issue**: The `JWT_SECRET`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and other sensitive information are hardcoded in the code. This can lead to exposure if the code is shared or stored in a public repository.\n- **Recommendation**: Ensure that sensitive information is stored securely in environment variables and not hardcoded. Use a secrets management tool if necessary.\n\n### 2. **Environment Variable Management**\n- **Issue**: The code loads environment variables from `.env` and `.env.local` files. If these files are not properly secured or are included in version control, sensitive information can be leaked.\n- **Recommendation**: Ensure that `.env` files are included in `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed to version control. Additionally, consider using a more secure method for managing environment variables in production.\n\n### 3. **Error Handling**\n- **Issue**: The error handling for the MongoDB connection logs the error message directly to the console. This could expose sensitive information about the database or application structure.\n- **Recommendation**: Avoid logging sensitive error messages. Instead, log a generic error message and consider using a logging library that can handle different log levels and outputs.\n\n### 4. **Node.js Version Check**\n- **Issue**: The check for Node.js version only ensures that the version is at least 20, but it does not account for security patches or vulnerabilities in that version.\n- **Recommendation**: Regularly update Node.js to the latest stable version and monitor for security advisories related to the version being used.\n\n### 5. **MongoDB Connection String**\n- **Issue**: The MongoDB connection string is taken from the environment variable `DATABASE`, but there is no validation or sanitization of this input. If an attacker can manipulate this variable, they could potentially connect to a malicious database.\n- **Recommendation**: Validate the format of the MongoDB connection string before using it. Consider using a library that can help with this.\n\n### 6. **Glob Pattern Usage**\n- **Issue**: The use of `globSync` to load model files can potentially lead to loading unintended files if the glob pattern is not specific enough.\n- **Recommendation**: Ensure that the glob pattern is specific to the intended files and does not allow for arbitrary file loading.\n\n### 7. **Public Server File Exposure"
