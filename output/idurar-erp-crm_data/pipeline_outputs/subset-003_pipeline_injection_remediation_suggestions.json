"To address the identified OWASP vulnerabilities in your application, here are the recommended remediations for each of the vulnerabilities listed:\n\n### A01:2021 - Broken Access Control\n\n1. **Lack of Authorization Checks**:\n   - Implement middleware to check user permissions before allowing actions such as creating, updating, or deleting invoices. For example, you can create a middleware function that verifies if the user has the necessary role or permission to perform the action.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     const authorize = (action) => {\n       return (req, res, next) => {\n         // Assuming req.user contains user information and permissions\n         if (req.user.permissions.includes(action)) {\n           return next();\n         }\n         return res.status(403).json({ success: false, message: 'Forbidden' });\n       };\n     };\n\n     // Usage in routes\n     app.post('/invoices', authorize('create_invoice'), create);\n     app.put('/invoices/:id', authorize('update_invoice'), update);\n     app.delete('/invoices/:id', authorize('delete_invoice'), remove);\n     ```\n\n2. **ID Exposure**:\n   - Before fetching an invoice by ID, check if the invoice belongs to the user making the request. You can modify the `findOne` queries to include a check for the `createdBy` field.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     const previousInvoice = await Model.findOne({\n       _id: req.params.id,\n       removed: false,\n       createdBy: req.admin._id // Ensure the invoice belongs to the user\n     });\n     ```\n\n### A03:2021 - Injection\n\n1. **Potential for Injection Attacks**:\n   - Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized. Use libraries like `express-validator` or `joi` to validate inputs before processing them.\n   - Example:\n     ```javascript\n     const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');\n\n     // Validation middleware\n     const validateInvoice = [\n       body('items').isArray().withMessage('Items must be an array'),\n       body('taxRate').isNumeric().withMessage('Tax rate must be a number'),\n       body('discount').isNumeric().withMessage('Discount must be a number'),\n     ];\n\n     // Usage in routes\n     app.post('/invoices', validateInvoice, create);\n     ```\n\n### A06:2021 - Security Misconfiguration\n\n1. **Generic Error Messages**:\n   - Modify error handling to return"
