"Based on the findings related to the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, here are detailed remediations for each identified issue:\n\n### 1. **A1:2021 - Broken Access Control**\n- **Finding**: The `isValidAuthToken` middleware's effectiveness is questionable.\n- **Recommendation**:\n  - Implement a robust token validation mechanism that includes:\n    - **Token Expiration**: Ensure tokens have a short lifespan and require refresh tokens for extended sessions.\n    - **Nonce Values**: Use unique nonce values for each request to prevent replay attacks.\n    - **Secure Storage**: Store tokens securely on the client side (e.g., in memory or secure storage) and avoid local storage for sensitive tokens.\n    - **Revocation Mechanism**: Implement a way to revoke tokens when necessary (e.g., user logout, password change).\n\n### 2. **A3:2021 - Sensitive Data Exposure**\n- **Finding**: Cookies are not secured properly.\n- **Recommendation**:\n  - Ensure cookies are set with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags to mitigate XSS risks:\n    ```javascript\n    res.cookie('name', 'value', { httpOnly: true, secure: true });\n    ```\n  - Consider implementing the `SameSite` attribute to prevent CSRF attacks:\n    ```javascript\n    res.cookie('name', 'value', { httpOnly: true, secure: true, sameSite: 'Strict' });\n    ```\n\n### 3. **A5:2021 - Security Misconfiguration**\n- **Finding**: CORS configuration is too permissive.\n- **Recommendation**:\n  - Specify allowed origins explicitly to limit access:\n    ```javascript\n    app.use(cors({\n      origin: ['https://example.com', 'https://another-example.com'],\n      credentials: true,\n    }));\n    ```\n  - Regularly review and update the CORS policy as needed.\n\n### 4. **A6:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components**\n- **Finding**: The commented-out file upload middleware can introduce vulnerabilities.\n- **Recommendation**:\n  - If file uploads are necessary, ensure to:\n    - Validate file types (e.g., only allow specific MIME types).\n    - Limit file sizes to prevent denial of service attacks.\n    - Sanitize file names to prevent directory traversal attacks.\n    - Use a library that provides secure file handling, such as `multer`, which allows for better control over file uploads.\n  - If file uploads"
